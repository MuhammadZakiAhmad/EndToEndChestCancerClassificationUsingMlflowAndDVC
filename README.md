# EndToEndChestCancerClassificationUsingMlflowAndDVC

A study be Gartner shows that only 54% of ML Projects make it from conception to production. As important it is to create a high performing ML Model, putting it to work i.e in production is equally important. In this project I have focused on the production/development aspect of ML lifecycle, Key features of this project include:

1. Modular Coding Structure ( Seperate stages/pipelines for data ingestion, model preparation, training, evaluation, prediction).

2. Experiment Tracking with Mlflow and Dagshub ( Integrated Mlflow to keep track of models with changing hyperparameters).

3. Stage Versioning with DVC.

4. Flask app for a user interface.

5. Dockerized the whole code.

6. Cloud Hosting with AWS(ECR AND EC2).

7. CI/CD using Github Actions.

Though at a small scale it embodies a production grade ML project and the template is robust for most use cases.
